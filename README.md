<h2>Azure Implementations</h2>

* Create a secure F1 SQL database that was linked to SSMS with secure authentication (username / password)
* Connected the Azure SQL database to SSMS and create the table using the crip provided
* Create and API to host the API with firewall security
* Published application to the Azure API hosting


<h2>How to Use the API</h2>

* Connect to the application hosted at: https://grwebapi-masterproject.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html 
* Create a new user with the (POST api/Authenticate/register “for Users” OR POST api/Authenticate/register-admin “for Admin)
